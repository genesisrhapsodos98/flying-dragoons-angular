But when i saw your stream, your laugh and the happiness you bring. I made a decision to start clipping just to let everyone know how great, funny and joy you are. I didnt wrote anything on your last birthday, So i'm not gonna be missing your second birthday. Hope you had a great time through out the year. Thanks very much for steeaming, i really enjoy your streams very much. Thanks🤗🤗  I'm getting busier and busier everyday, So making clips everyday i used to be is quite tough for me. I hope to clip more in the future to show everyone how funny and the amount of joy and happiness you bring to chat. As there's a saying, Girl who loves to laugh, They would be lucky. So hoping more and more people notice you. Hope you have a great time on your birthday.   Ps. Sorry if I chat less on your stream, Cuz I'm quite shy in public...",
